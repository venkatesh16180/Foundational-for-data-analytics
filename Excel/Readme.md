# Excel

The Excel section of this repository contains a variety of resources, templates, and tutorials aimed at enhancing your data analysis skills using Microsoft Excel. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refine your skills, you will find valuable materials here.*

Do not overlook the importance of Excel. This Ancient yet Powerful tool was made in 1985 that means it can legally drive in the US by the time I was born. Anyway I did the mistake of overlooking Excel in the beginning of my Data Analyst Journey and only found out its importance after watching all the Data Analyst on Youtube(I am looking at you Alex The Analyst, Mo-Chen, Luke Barousse) I never used it in Bachelors or in Master. That made me think and I found the reason for that which kinda makes sense to be honest, drum roll please, Its because almost all the Computer not come with the Microsoft Suite or every one use the Big 3 of the Microsoft Suite at atleast one point of their life so a sense of familiarity for the person working with Excel. Check out this reddit post for more on that(https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/10a0n0u/excel_is_extremely_old_why_has_it_endured_why/)

The kinds of excel files you can find in here can range from exploring basic functionalities of the Excel along with my personal comments of course(If you dont understand my personal comments too bad if we were to meet and talk it would be very dry and you might almost think I am talking a completely difference language) to Portfolio Projects.(Thats just two kinds for not I will make changes in here if i can think of any other kind)
